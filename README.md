# Process Scheduler Simulation

An interactive web-based simulator for visualizing and understanding popular CPU scheduling algorithms:

- 🔵 First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- 🔶 Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF - Preemptive SJF)
- 🟡 Priority Scheduling
- 🔁 Round Robin (RR)
- 🔶 Shortest job First (SJF)

Designed for students and educators studying Operating Systems, this tool simulates process scheduling with clear visual outputs.
